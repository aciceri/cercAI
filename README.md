This is a project thrown together in one morning using Claude Code to test an idea I had under a beach umbrella.

## What is this?

A fake search engine that returns plausible results pretending to be a real search engine, then dynamically generates web pages (both HTML and CSS) to render. Each page is different every time.

## How it works

- No backend
- Requests are made directly from the frontend
- You need to set an API key (currently supports OpenRouter and ChatGPT)
- Most of my testing was done using Gemini 2.5 Flash because I'm cheap

## Note

Sometimes pages might not generate properly - if that happens, just open a new page.

## Important

This project means nothing, it's just messing around.
